#CAST

What is this repo or project?

CAST can
enhance the system management of cluster-wide resources. It consists of the
open source tools: cluster system management (CSM) and burst buffer. 

CSM provides an integrated view of your
large cluster and includes discovery and management of system resources,
database integration, support of job launches, diagnostics, RAS events and
actions, and health check. 

Burst buffer is a cost-effective mechanism that can improve I/O performance for a large class of
high-performance computing applications without requirement of intermediary hardware. Burst buffer provides a fast storage
tier between compute nodes and the traditional parallel file system, allowing
overlapping jobs to stage-in and stage-out data for a variety of
checkpoint/restart, scratch volume, and extended memory I/O workloads.
