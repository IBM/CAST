# CAST
CAST can enhance the system management of cluster-wide resources. It consists of the open source tools: Cluster System Management (CSM), Burst Buffer and Function Shipping. 

**CSM** provides an integrated view of your large cluster and includes discovery and management of system resources, database integration, support of job launches, diagnostics, RAS events and actions, and health check. 

**Burst Buffer** is a cost-effective mechanism that can improve I/O performance for a large class of high-performance computing applications without requirement of intermediary hardware. Burst Buffer provides a fast storage tier between compute nodes and the traditional parallel file system, allowing overlapping jobs to stage-in and stage-out data for a variety of checkpoint/restart, scratch volume, and extended memory I/O workloads. 

**Function Shipping** is a file I/O forwarding layer for Linux that aims to provide low-jitter access to remote parallel file system while retaining common POSIX semantics.
