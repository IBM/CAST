# CAST
CAST can enhance the system management of cluster-wide resources. It consists of the open source tools: cluster system management (CSM) and burst buffer. 

CSM provides an integrated view of your large cluster and includes discovery and management of system resources,database integration, support of job launches, diagnostics, RAS events and actions, and health check. 

Burst Buffer is a cost-effective mechanism that can improve I/O performance for a large class of high-performance computing applications without requirement of intermediary hardware. Burst buffer provides a fast storage tier between compute nodes and the traditional parallel file system, allowing overlapping jobs to stage-in and stage-out data for a variety of checkpoint/restart, scratch volume, and extended memory I/O workloads.
