Configuring the CSM PAM module
==============================

A CSM PAM module is packaged in **ibm-csm-core** RPM, the following files are installed:

* /etc/pam.d/csm/activelist

* /etc/pam.d/csm/whitelist

* /etc/pam.d/csm/README.md

* /usr/lib64/security/libcsmpam.so

The RPM also adds a disabled line of code to ``/etc/pam.d/sshd``.

To enable the module for ssh, simply uncomment the added line in ``/etc/pam.d/sshd`` and restart the ssh daemon as outlined in the CSM PAM Module section in the CSM Installation and Configuration Guide. The basic configuration will restrict ssh connections to the root user and any users with an active allocation on the node (who will be placed in the allocation cgroup).

Adding a user to the ``/etc/pam.d/csm/whitelist`` file will authorize them to access the node at any time. This file is new line delimited and will allow any users defined to access through the CSM PAM module. If the system administrator has modified this file, then it will not be removed when ibm-csm-core is uninstalled.

The ``libcsmpam.so`` PAM module is a session module and conforms to the settings described in the pam.conf man page. The only officially supported configuration, however, is bundled in the RPM installation.

For more details about the CSM PAM module, please refer to the bundled ``/etc/pam.d/csm/README.md`` documentation. This document goes into more depth on the behavior of the module, describes the purpose of the active list and provides additional configurations.


CSM Pam Daemon Module
---------------------

The `libcsmpam.so` module is installed by the rpm to `/usr/lib64/security/libcsmpam.so`.

To enable the this module for sshd perform the following steps:

1. Uncomment the following line in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`
    
.. code-block:: bash

    #account    required     libcsmpam.so   
    #session    required     libcsmpam.so

.. note::  The `libcsmpam.so` module is deliberately configured to be the last session in this file. 
    If your configuration changes this make sure the `libcsmpam.so` is loaded after the default 
    session modules. It is recommended that `libcsmpam.so` be immediately after the default 
    `postlogin` line in the sshd config if the admin is adding additional session modules.
      
2. Run `systemctl restart  sshd.service` to restart the sshd daemon with the new config.

After the daemon has been restarted the modified pam sshd configuration should now be used.

Module Behavior
---------------

This module is designed for session authentication and cgroup assignment in the pam sshd utility.
The following checks are performed to verify that the user is allowed to access the system:

1. The user is root.
    * Allow entry.
    * Place the user in the default cgroup (session only).
    * Exit module with success.
2. The user is defined in `/etc/pam.d/csm/activelist`.
    * Allow entry.
    * Place the session in the cgroup that the user is associated with in the `activelist` (session only).
    * *note:* The `activelist` is modified by csm, admins should not modify.
    * Exit module with success.
3. The user is defined in `/etc/pam.d/csm/whitelist`.
    * Allow entry.
    * Place the user in the default cgroup (session only).
    * *note:* The `whitelist` is modified by the admin.
    * Exit module with success.
4. The user was not found.
    * Exit the module, rejecting the user.
    

Module Configuration
--------------------
Configuration may occur in either a pam configuration file (e.g. `/etc/pam.d/sshd`) or the
csm pam `whitelist`.

libcsmpam.so
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:File location: `/usr/lib64/security/libcsmpam.so`
:Configurable: Through pam configuration file.   

The `libcsmpam.so` is a session pam module. For details on configuring this module and other
pam modules please consult the linux man page; `man pam.conf`.

When `ibm-csm-core` is uninstalled, this library is always removed.


.. warning:: The `libcsmpam.so` module is recommended be the last session line in the default pam configuration file. 
    The module requires the session to be established to move the session to the correct cgroup.
    If the module is invoked too early in the configuration, users will not be placed in the correct cgroup.
    This advice is configuration dependant.


whitelist
^^^^^^^^^

:File location: `/etc/pam.d/csm/whitelist` 
:Configurable: Yes                        

The `whitelist` is a newline delimited list of user names. If a user is specified they will
always be allowed to login to the node. 

If the user has an active allocation on the node an attempt will be made to place them 
in the correct allocation cgroup. Otherwise, the use will be placed in the default cgroup.

When `ibm-csm-core` is uninstalled, if this file has been modified it will *NOT* be deleted.

**Sample Configuration File**

.. code-block:: none

    jdunham
    pmix
    csm_admin

The preceding configuration will add three users who will always be allowed to start a session.
If the user has an active allocation they will be placed into the appropriate cgroup as
described above.

activelist
----------

:File location: `/etc/pam.d/csm/whitelist` 
:Configurable: No                         

The `activelist` file should not be modified by the admin or user. CSM will modify this file
when an allocation is created or deleted.

The file contains a newline delimited list of entries with the following format: 
`[user_name];[allocation_id]`. This format is parsed by `libcsmpam.so` to determine
whether or not a user can begin the session (`username`) and which cgroup it belongs 
to (`allocation_id`).

When `ibm-csm-core` is uninstalled, this file is always removed.

Module Compilation
------------------
.. note:: Ignore this section if the csm pam module is being installed by rpm.

In order to compile this module the `pam-devel` package is required to compile.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If users are having problems with core isolation, unable to log onto the node, or not being placed into the correct cgroup, first perform the following steps.

1. Manually create an allocation on a node that has the PAM module configured. This should be executed from the launch node as a non root user.

.. code-block:: bash

     $ csm_allocation_create -j 1 -n <node_name> --cgroup_type 2
     ---
     allocation_id: <allocation_id>
     num_nodes: 1
     - compute_nodes:  <node_name>
     user_name: root
     user_id: 0
     state: running
     type: user managed
     job_submit_time: 2018-01-04 09:01:17
     ...

**POSSIBLE FAILURES**

* If the allocation create fails, ensure the node is ready:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ csm_node_attributes_update -r y -n <node_name>
    
2. After the allocation has been created with core isolation ssh to the node `<node_name>` as the user who created the allocation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ssh <node_name>

**POSSIBLE FAILURES**

    * `User Rejected: <user_name>; Not Authorized`   
       
       Indicates the `/etc/pam.d/csm/activelist` was not populated with `<user_name>`.
   
    * Verify the allocation is currently active, if the allocation is not currently active attempt to recreate the allocation.

        ``csm_allocation_query_active_all | grep "allocation_id.* <allocation_id>$"``
       
    * Login to <node_name> as root and check to see if the user is on the activelist:
      ``$ ssh <node_name> -l root "grep <user_name> /etc/pam.d/csm/activelist"``

       If the user is not present and the allocation create is functioning this may be a CSM bug, 
       open a defect to the CSM team.
         
3. Check the cgroup of the user's ssh session.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /proc/self/cgroup
    11:blkio:/
    10:memory:/allocation_<allocation_id>
    9:hugetlb:/
    8:devices:/allocation_<allocation_id>
    7:freezer:/
    6:cpuset:/allocation_<allocation_id>
    5:net_prio,net_cls:/
    4:perf_event:/
    3:cpuacct,cpu:/
    2:pids:/
    1:name=systemd:/user.slice/user-9999137.slice/session-3957.scope

Above is an example of a properly configured cgroup. The user should be in an allocation cgroup for the `memory`, `devices` and `cpuset` groups.
    
**POSSIBLE FAILURES**

    * The user is only in the `cpuset:/csm_system` cgroup
      This generally indicates that the `libcsmpam.so` module was not added in the correct location or is disabled. 
      Refer to the quick start at the top of this document for more details.
      
    * The user is in the `cpuset:/` cgroup.
      Indicates that core isolation was not performed, verify core isolation is enabled in the allocation create step.
      
 4. Any further issues are beyond the scope of this trouble shooting document, contacting the CSM team or opening a new issue is the recommended course of action.
