=head1 NAME

bbcmd - perform burst buffer user commands

=head1 SYNOPSIS

bbcmd [COMMAND] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Burst Buffer services can be accessed from the Launch and Login nodes via the bbCmd tool.
It allows checkpoint libraries, such as SCR, to dynamically determine which file(s) to
transfer between GPFS and the compute node's local SSD and to start/stop/query transfers.
It also allows for privileged users to manage SSD logical volumes and query hardware state.

=head2 OUTPUT

The bbCmd tool will wait until a response is received from the service. For each command,
multiple types of data may be returned from the call. Since higher levels of software,
such as SCR, plan to provide additional tooling that may depend on responses from bbCmd, it is important to ensure that the output from bbCmd is easily machine parseable.
By default, the output from bbCmd will be returned in JSON format. The toplevel hierarchy of the JSON
output will be a target identifier sufficiently precise to identify individual job or job step
components. This allows for multiple job components (e.g. MPI ranks) to be targeted by a
single command, and yet keep the returned data separate for subsequent parsing.
If desired, bbCmd can alternatively output in XML format (--xml) or a more human-readable
pretty printed format (--pretty).
All commands will return an attribute called 'rc'. This contains the result code of the operation.
Zero indicates success and a non zero value indicates command failure.
