# How to Contribute

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity made for the benefit of the CAST Community, a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") must be on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the CAST Community and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Please print, fill out, and sign either the corporate agreement [cast-project-cla-corporate.pdf](https://github.com/IBM/CAST/blob/master/cast-project-cla-corporate.pdf) or the individual agreement [cast-project-cla-individual.pdf](https://github.com/IBM/CAST/blob/master/cast-project-cla-individual.pdf). Once complete, scan the document as a pdf file and email this agreement to tgooding@us.ibm.com and pizzano@us.ibm.com.

Thank you for your interest in the Cluster Administration and Storage Tools (CAST) project at https://github.com/IBM/CAST
