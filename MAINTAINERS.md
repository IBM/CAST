# Build Machine Software Requirements

The following are the minimum recommended levels of software for a build machine.

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 for ppc64 LE
- cmake 3.7.1
- boost 1.55.0

# Build Instructions

what I am using
```
scripts/configure.pl --rpmbuild --parallel --mincmake=3.6
scripts/rebuild package noinstall
```
```
To build the tree:
   % scripts/configure.pl
   % . SETUP.sh
   % build

SETUP.sh is generated by the configure script.  It sets environment variables, include PATH.

% build help
  Shows a list of possible build targets.

% build package
  Builds the RPMs.  For official builds, the work directory must specify the eventual install directory.  

% build bb
  Builds targets for toplevel directory 'bb'.  Only targets that were installed with the doinstall() macro will be built.  

% build burstbuffer
  Builds targets for RPM 'burstbuffer'.  Only targets that were installed with the doinstall() macro will be built.  

If there is a need to rebuild the tree from scratch:
   % rebuild

```
By default, the install directory is CAST/work
By default, the build directory is CAST/.build

You should not need to access files in the .build directory unless you are generating files.

cmake and Boost libraries need to be installed on the system you're building on:
      If your system is downlevel, run this script:
           scripts/prereq.pl
