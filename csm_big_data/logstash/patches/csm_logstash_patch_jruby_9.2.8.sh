#=================
#
# Reason for this patch: 
#
# When the JRuby Application (logstash) is loaded a LoadError is thrown by ffi/ffi. The bubbled error message is somewhat vague (to a user ignorant to JRuby).
#
# [2019-05-03T10:41:38,701][ERROR][org.logstash.Logstash    ] 
# java.lang.IllegalStateException: Logstash stopped processing because of an error: 
# (LoadError) load error: ffi/ffi -- java.lang.NullPointerException: null
#
# I was able to trace the bug to jruby/lib/ruby/stdlib/ffi/platform/powerpc64-linux/. It looks
# as though the platform.conf file was not created for this platform. Copying the types.conf file to platform.conf appears to resolve the problem.
#
# GitHub Issue: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/10755
